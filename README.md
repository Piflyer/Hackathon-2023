# Hackathon-2023
[Sid](https://github.com/Sid220) and I worked on a mini metaverse that functions a video calling site. This can be used as a virtual hangout and get together for distant friends and family.

View it live [here.](https://winterwonderland.plios.tech/)

## Specs:
* Used Aframe.js and Networked Aframe
* JS based
